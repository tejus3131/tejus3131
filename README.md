# Hey, I’m Tejus Gupta 👋

**Software Engineer**  
Focused on systems, developer tooling, and AI agents

## About

I’m a software engineer who enjoys building things and understanding how they work at a low level.

I like breaking large systems into smaller, solvable problems and making them work reliably.  
Most of my work revolves around **developer tooling, CLI applications, automation, and AI agent systems**.

When I build, I value quality above everything — in code, in user experience, and in long-term maintainability.  
I care deeply about clean setups, automation, and making things feel *done*, not just *working*.

I’m especially excited by recurring, real-world problems — the kind where writing a tool once can save hours every day.

## Philosophy

> *Software development is an art that requires technical depth — not a stressful job, but a craft I genuinely enjoy practicing.*

I prefer strong fundamentals over shortcuts and clarity over cleverness.  
Good tools should feel natural to use, predictable in behavior, and easy to maintain.

## What I’m Working On

- Building **production-grade CLI tools** and **AI agent systems**
- Exploring **networking concepts** for tooling: custom protocols, relay servers, and peer-to-peer communication
- Improving automation and ergonomics in my Linux development environment

## How I Build

For any new project, I start with a solid foundation before writing application logic:

- CI/CD
- Testing
- Linting & formatting
- Pre-commit hooks

Once the foundation is in place, I focus on:
1. Correctness  
2. Performance  
3. Readability  
4. Documentation  

User experience is non-negotiable — every tool I build should feel easy and natural to use.

## Selected Work

I work on open-source projects around:
- AI agents and agent frameworks
- Developer tooling and automation
- CLI applications
- Systems-oriented experiments

Pinned repositories showcase the projects I’m most proud of.
